# Useful commands

```
pip3 install z3-solver
pip3 install more-itertools
pip3 install numpy
python3 y20AB/dayXY.py
python3 -m pytest
```

# Types

In theory:
```
pip3 install mypy
python3 -m mypy file.py
```

In VS Code, in settings, search for "Mypy" and enable it.

In practice, I didn't find Z3 Mypy type definitions, so type checking does not work.
