# Useful commands

Note - Python 3 is required.

```
pip install z3-solver
pip install more-itertools
pip install numpy
pip install pytest
python y20AB/dayXY.py
python -m pytest
```

# Types

In theory:
```
pip install mypy
python -m mypy file.py
```

In VS Code, in settings, search for "Mypy" and enable it.

In practice, I didn't find Z3 Mypy type definitions, so type checking does not work.
